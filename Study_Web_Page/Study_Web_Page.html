          <p class="text-small-1">
            Studying is a key skill used not only in education, but also in
            day-to-day life. It builds knowledge and understanding of a subject
            area which helps prepares you for your future. Whether that involves
            advancing in your education or embarking on a new job or
            apprenticeship. Generally, developing good study skills is great for
            your personal growth and your future endeavors.

            <br />
            When you're in school, studying is a big deal as it is essential
            when trying to achieve the targets and grades you want. This is
            especially true if you are considering moving on to further
            education. Such as going to university. However, study and research
            skills are also something that employers look for when recruiting.
            It shows a willingness to learn and understand what an industry is
            about. It also proves that you can take the initiative to explore,
            research and build skills on your own. Studying is not just
            important for educational development, but also builds personal
            skills. Having good study skills can improve your confidence,
            competence, and self-esteem. As well as helps reduce stress and
            anxiety around deadlines and exams.

          What is Science and Why we study Science?
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Science is the study of the universe around us and within us, natural
          phenomena, and solutions to problems. Scientists want to observe
          natural phenomena or events to understand the mechanisms that cause
          them and explain how or why those natural events occur.Throughout the
          Research strand, Challenge B students (ages 13 and older) learn many
          wonderful lessons through studying science that help them understand
          the world more fully and become better researchers. This post explores
          several reasons why learning science is essential by examining the
          research Challenge B students conduct on the lives and discoveries of
          famous historical scientists.

          <br />
          <b>There are 5 Reason we study Science? </b>
          1. Studying Science Inspires Curiosity and an Attitude of Discovery.
          2. Studying Science Offers Perspective. 3. Studying Science Encourages
          the Integration of Subjects and Ideas. 4. Studying Science Promotes
          Truth-Seeking. 5. Studying Science Trains Us to Ask Good Questions and
          Find Good Answers.

          What is Mathematics and Why Do We Study Mathematics?
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and
          change. Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures,
          and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen
          axioms and definitions. Mathematics, the science of structure, order,
          and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting,
          measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical
          reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has
          involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its
          subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an
          indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in
          more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative
          aspects of the life sciences
          <br />
          <b>Why Do We Study Mathematics? </b>
          Math helps strengthen reasoning skills and critical thinking. It helps
          us think analytically about the world and reason logically. The same
          steps you take to understand a problem, identify the knows and unknows
          and then solve it, can be applied to other areas of your life.
          <br />
          <b>There are 4 reasons to study mathematics</b>
          1. Understand the world. 2. Become a problem solver. 3. Develop
          transferable skills. 4. Discover excellent graduate prospects

          What is Computer and Why do we study Computer?
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or
          data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may
          already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send
          email, play games, and browse the Web. A computer is a programmable
          electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to
          a set of instructions called a program. It can store, retrieve, and
          process data, making it a versatile tool for various applications.
          Computers come in various forms, including personal computers
          (desktops and laptops), servers, mainframes, and embedded systems in
          devices like smartphones and appliances. Key components of a computer
          include a central processing unit (CPU), which executes instructions;
          memory (RAM), which stores data temporarily; storage devices (such as
          hard drives or solid-state drives), which store data permanently;
          input devices (like keyboards and mice) for user interaction; output
          devices (such as monitors and printers) for displaying information;
          and communication interfaces for connecting to networks and other
          devices.
          <br />
          <b>Why do we study Computer?</b>
          <br />
          Computers are used in virtually every industry, so computer scientists
          can take their pick. Computers can solve problems in science,
          engineering, healthcare and so many other areas. It's up to the
          computer scientist to figure out how to design software that applies
          the solution.
